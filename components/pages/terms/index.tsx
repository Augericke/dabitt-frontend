                    <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
                    <p>
                      This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is
                      referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.”
                      You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have
                      arisen or may arise between you and dabitts, whether
                      arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any
                      alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, or
                      any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us,
                      will be resolved exclusively through final and binding
                      arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
                      terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may
                      assert individual claims in small claims court, if your
                      claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does
                      not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
                      federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can,
                      if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
                      You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and
                      dabitts are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
                      to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
                      determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
                      The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                      enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

                    <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>
                    <p>
                      dabitts is always interested in resolving disputes
                      amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can
                      be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by
                      emailing dabitts at inquiries@dabitts.com. If such efforts
                      prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek
                      arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
                      mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice
                      to dabitts should be sent to dabitts LLC, 251 LITTLE FALLS
                      DRIVE, WILMINGTON, DE 19808 (“Notice Address”). The Notice
                      must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
                      dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If
                      dabitts and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60)
                      calendar days after the Notice is received, you or dabitts
                      may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                      arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
                      dabitts or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator
                      until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any,
                      to which you or dabitts is entitled.

                    <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
                    <p>
                      Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
                      accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s
                      (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer
                      Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as
                      modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
                      the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.
                      Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer
                      disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration
                      page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any
                      inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any
                      term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms
                      of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
                      arbitrator determines that the application of the
                      inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result
                      in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must
                      also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court
                      would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                      including issues relating to the scope, enforceability,
                      and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although
                      arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
                      streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings,
                      the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                      individual basis that a court can award to an individual
                      under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the
                      arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned
                      by a court only for very limited reasons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Unless dabitts and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
                      hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient
                      location for both parties with due consideration of their
                      ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If
                      the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
                      determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for
                      $10,000 or less, dabitts agrees that you may choose
                      whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
                      basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                      telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
                      established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
                      $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
                      AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                      arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a
                      reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                      essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                      based.

                    <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
                    <p>
                      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
                      (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by
                      the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
                      Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees
                      are not specifically allocated to either dabitts or you
                      under the AAA Rules, dabitts and you shall split them
                      equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to
                      the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay
                      your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
                      otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be
                      required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees,
                      dabitts will pay your portion of such fees. In addition,
                      if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
                      arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs
                      of litigation, dabitts will pay as much of the Arbitration
                      Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
                      arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of
                      attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

                    <p>
                      All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling,
                      decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
                      confidential for the benefit of all parties.

                      If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or
                      provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the
                      subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
                      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”
                      above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
                      replace such term or provision with a term or provision
                      that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
                      expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
                      term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be
                      enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator
                      decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above
                      titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
                      and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or
                      unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
                      Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions
                      are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with
                      respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The
                      remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.

                <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

                  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
                  dabitts and govern your use of the Services, superseding any
                  prior agreements between you and dabitts with respect thereto.
                  Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
                  solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to
                  confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or
                  entity. You also may be subject to additional terms and
                  conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third
                  party services, third party content or third party software.
                  The failure of dabitts to exercise or enforce any right or
                  provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such
                  right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute
                  or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
